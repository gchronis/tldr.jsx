# tldr.jsx
> ðŸ“š A Reactive web client for [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr). Try it [here](http://tldr.ostera.io).

## Featuring

* `Unique URIs`, to easily share any `tldr-page`!
* `Mobile-first-ish`, to take with you anywhere!
* `Fully Reactive`, embracing `ES6`, `RxJS`, and `React` for great win!

## Roadmap

As [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) advances, new features can be planned. Some are:

* `Autocompletion`, freeing you from remembering all those command names
* `Search`, letting you search through all the pages and commands content to find what you want

## Collaboration Setup

It requires a working `node` environment with `npm`, and `make`.

* `make build`, for a development build
* `make test`, to run the test suite
* `make lint`, to lint the source
* `make check`, to type-check everything
* `make package`, to create a distributable package

Serve locally as you wish, I prefer [static-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/static-server).

#### But what about Y or X and File Watchers!

File Watchers never really manage to work the way you want them to, so I ended up using [ostera/watch](https://github.com/ostera/watch) for auto-building, auto-testing, auto-anything.
