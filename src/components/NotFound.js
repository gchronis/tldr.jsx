    ### How can I help?
{Cr}
    Take a look at the open <Link href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acommand" text="Command Requests" /> to throw a jab at things people need, or maybe join in on any of the open <Link href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pulls" text="command proposals" />.

    If the command you want hasn't been proposed yet, feel encouraged to submit a proposal yourself! ðŸ˜‰ &mdash; <Link href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" text="Start here" />
